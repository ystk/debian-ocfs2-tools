.SH "NAME"
mount.ocfs2 \-  mount an \fIOCFS2\fR filesystem
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmount.ocfs2\fR [\fI\-vn\fR] [\fB\-o options\fR] \fIdevice\fR \fIdir\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBmount.ocfs2\fR mounts an \fIOCFS2\fR filesystem at \fIdir\fR. It is usually
invoked indirectly by the mount(8) command when using the \fI-t ocfs2\fR option.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\_netdev\fR
The filesystem resides on a device that requires network access (used to prevent
the system from attempting to mount these filesystems until the network has
been enabled on the system). \fImount.ocfs2\fR transparently appends this option
during mount. However, users mounting the volume via /etc/fstab must explicitly
specify this mount option to delay the system from mounting the volume until
after the network has been enabled.

.TP
\fBatime\_quantum=nrsec\fR
The file system will not update atime unless this number of seconds has passed
since the last update. Set to zero to always update atime. It defaults to 60 secs.

.TP
\fBrelatime\fR
The file system only update atime if the previous atime is older than mtime or ctime.

.TP
\fBnoatime\fR
The file system will not update access time.

.TP
\fBacl / noacl\fR
Enables / disables POSIX ACLs (Access Control Lists) support.

.TP
\fBuser_xattr / nouser_xattr\fR
Enables / disables Extended User Attributes.

.TP
\fBcommit=nrsec\fR
Sync all data and metadata every nrsec seconds. The default value is 5 seconds.
Zero means default.

.TP
\fBdata=ordered / data=writeback\fR
Specifies the handling of file data during metadata journalling.
.RS 1.2i
.TP
\fBordered\fR
This is the default mode. All data is forced directly out to the main file
system prior to its metadata being committed to the journal.
.RE
.RS 1.2i
.TP
\fBwriteback\fR
Data  ordering is not preserved - data may be written into the main file system
after its metadata has been committed to the journal. This is rumored to be
the highest-throughput option. While it guarantees internal file system
integrity, it can allow old data to appear in files after a crash and journal
recovery.
.RE

.TP
\fBdatavolume\fR
\fIThis mount option has been \fBdeprecated\fR in OCFS2 1.6\fR. It has been used
in the past (\fIOCFS2 1.2\fR and \fIOCFS2 1.4\fR), to force the Oracle RDBMS to
issue direct IOs to the hosted data files, control files, redo logs, archive logs,
voting disk, cluster registry, etc. It has been deprecated because it is no longer
required. Oracle RDBMS users should instead use the \fIinit.ora\fR parameter,
\fIfilesystemio_options\fR, to enable direct IOs.

.TP
\fBerrors=remount-ro / errors=panic\fR
Define the behavior when an error is encountered. (Either remount the file
system read-only, or panic and halt the system.) By default, the file system
is remounted read only.

.TP
\fBlocalflocks\fR
This disables cluster-aware flock(2).

.TP
\fBintr / nointr\fR
The default is intr that allows signals to interrupt cluster operations.
nointr disables signals during cluster operations.

.TP
\fBro\fR
Mount the file system read-only.

.TP
\fBrw\fR
Mount the file system read-write.
