ocfs2-tools (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Lazo rosa" release.
  * New upstream release.  This version was released on Apr 6th, 2007.  Main
    changes are:
    - Allow network timeout configuration.
    - Bug fixes.
    - offsetof(3) issues have been fixed, so patches/102_stddef.h is no longer
      relevant.
  * Added debconf support for O2CB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS, O2CB_KEEPALIVE_DELAY_MS
    and O2CB_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS in postinst, config and templates mainly from
    Ubuntu.
  * po/es.po: While at it, updated Spanish translation.
  * po/vi.po: Updated Vietnamese translation, thanks to Clytie Siddall
    (closes: #438451).
  * po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (closes:
    #438633).
  * po/fr.po: Updated French translation.  Thanks to Jean-Baka
    Domelevo-Entfellner (closes: #440579).
  * po/cs.po: Updated Czech translation.  Thanks to Miroslav Kure (closes:
    #442903).
  * Added /etc/init.d/ocfs2 in order to mount and unmount OCFS2 volumes, that I
    simply missed on past releases.  This allows to unmount OCFS2 during a
    reboot and thus avoid a panic (closes: #416550).
  * debian/rules: Removed old code for quilt patching now that we include the
    Makefile from that package.
  * This version does not fail to build twice in a row (strange...).  Closes:
    #442692.
