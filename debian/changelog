ocfs2-tools (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

    changes are:
    - Allow network timeout configuration.
    - Bug fixes.
    - offsetof(3) issues have been fixed, so patches/102_stddef.h is no longer
      relevant.
  * Added debconf support for O2CB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS, O2CB_KEEPALIVE_DELAY_MS
    and O2CB_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS in postinst, config and templates mainly from
    Ubuntu.

  * debian/rules: Removed old code for quilt patching now that we include the
    Makefile from that package.
  * This version does not fail to build twice in a row (strange...).  Closes:
