ocfs2-tools (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The init script needs modules now in order to function properly.  Upstream
    strongly discourages the changes I did in 1.1.5 in order to work for the
    monolithic kernel case.
    The sctp module is no longer necessary.  Please read
    /usr/share/doc/ocfs2-tools/README.Debian for the complete requirements.
