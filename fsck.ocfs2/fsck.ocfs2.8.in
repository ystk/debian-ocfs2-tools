.SH "NAME"
fsck.ocfs2 \- Check an \fIOCFS2\fR file system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBfsck.ocfs2\fR [ \fB\-pafFGnuvVy\fR ] [ \fB\-b\fR \fIsuperblock block\fR ] [ \fB\-B\fR \fIblock size\fR ] \fIdevice\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBfsck.ocfs2\fR is used to check an OCFS2 file system.

\fIdevice\fR is the file where the file system is stored (e.g. \fI/dev/sda1\fR).
It will almost always be a device file but a regular file will work as well.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-a\fR
This option does the same thing as the \fB-p\fR option.  It is provided for
backwards compatibility only: it is suggested that people use the \fB-p\fR
option whenever possible.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR \fIsuperblock block\fR
Normally, \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR will read the superblock from the first block of
the device.  This option specifies an alternate block that the superblock
should be read from. (Use \fB\-r\fR instead of this option.)

.TP
\fB\-B\fR \fIblocksize\fR
The \fIblock size\fR, specified in bytes, can range from 512 to 4096.
A value of 0, the default, is used to indicate that the blocksize should be automatically detected.

.TP
\fB\-D\fR
Optimize directories in filesystem. This option causes fsck.ocfs2 to
coalesce the directory entries in order to improve the filesystem
performance.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Force checking even if the file system is clean. 

.TP
\fB\-F\fR
By default \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR will check with the cluster services to ensure that
the volume is not in-use (mounted) on any node in the cluster before proceeding.
\fB-F\fR skips this check and should only be used when it can be guaranteed that
the volume is not mounted on any node in the cluster. \fBWARNING: If the cluster
check is disabled and the volume is mounted on one or more nodes, file system
corruption is very likely. If unsure, do not use this option.\fR

.TP
\fB\-G\fR
Usually \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR will silently assume inodes whose generation number
does not match the generation number of the super block are unused inodes.
This option causes \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR to ask the user if these inodes should in
fact be marked unused.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR
Give the 'no' answer to all questions that fsck will ask.  This guarantees
that the file system will not be modified and the device will be opened
read-only.  The output of \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR with this option can be redirected
to produce a record of a file system's faults.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR
Automatically repair ("preen") the file system.  This option will cause
\fBfsck.ocfs2\fR to automatically fix any problem that can be safely
corrected without human intervention.  If there are problems that require
intervention, the descriptions will be printed and fsck.ocfs2 will exit
with the value 4 logically or'd into the exit code.  (See the
\fBEXIT CODE\fR section.)  This option is normally used by the system's
boot scripts.

.TP
\fB\-r\fR \fIbackup-number\fR
\fImkfs.ocfs2\fR makes upto 6 backup copies of the superblock at offsets
1G, 4G, 16G, 64G, 256G and 1T depending on the size of the volume.
Use this option to specify the backup, 1 thru 6, to use to recover the
superblock.

.TP
\fB\-y\fR 
Give the 'yes' answer to all questions that fsck will ask.  This will repair
all faults that \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR finds but will not give the operator a chance to intervene if \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR decides that it wants to drastically repair the file system.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR 
This option causes \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR to produce a very large amount of debugging output.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR 
Print version information and exit.

.SH EXIT CODE
The exit code returned by \fBfsck.ocfs2\fR is the sum of the following conditions:
.br
\	0\	\-\ No errors
.br
\	1\	\-\ File system errors corrected
.br
\	2\	\-\ File system errors corrected, system should
.br
\	\	\ \ be rebooted
.br
\	4\	\-\ File system errors left uncorrected
.br
\	8\	\-\ Operational error
.br
\	16\	\-\ Usage or syntax error
.br
\	32\	\-\ fsck.ocfs2 canceled by user request
.br
\	128\	\-\ Shared library error
.br
