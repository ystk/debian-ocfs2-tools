.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBtunefs.ocfs2\fR is used to adjust \fIOCFS2\fR file system parameters on disk.
The tool expects the cluster to be online as it needs to take the appropriate
cluster locks to write safely to disk.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-\-cloned\-volume\fR[=\fInew-label]\fR
Change the volume UUID (auto-generated) and the label, if provided, of a cloned \fIOCFS2\fR volume.
This option does \fBnot\fR perform volume cloning. It only changes the UUID and label on a cloned
volume so that it can be mounted on the node that has the original volume mounted.

.TP
\fB\-\-fs\-features=\fR\fI[no]sparse...\fR
Turn specific file system features on or off. \fItunefs.ocfs2\fR will attempt to enable or disable the feature list provided. To enable a feature, include it in the list. To disable a feature, prepend \fBno\fR to the name. For a list of feature names, see the man page for \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR.

.TP
\fB\-J, \-\-journal\-options\fR \fIoptions\fR
Modify the journal using options specified on the command\-line. Journal options are comma separated, and may take an argument using the equals ('=') sign. For a list of possible options, see the man page for \fBmkfs.ocfs2\fR.

.TP
\fB\-L, \-\-label\fR \fIvolume\-label\fR
Change the volume label of the file system. Limit the label to under 64 bytes.

.TP
\fB\-N, \-\-node\-slots\fR \fInumber\-of\-node\-slots\fR
Valid number ranges from 1 to 255. This number specifies the maximum number of
nodes that can concurrently mount the partition. Use this to increase or
decrease the number of node slots. One reason to decrease could be to release
the space consumed by the journals for those slots.

.TP
\fB\-S, \-\-volume\-size\fR
Grow the size of the \fIOCFS2\fR file system. If \fIblocks-count\fR is not
specified, \fItunefs.ocfs2\fR extends the volume to the current size of
the device.

.TP
\fB\-Q, \-\-query\fR \fIquery\-format\fR
Query the file system for its attributes like block size, label, etc. Query formats are modified
versions of the standard printf(3) formatting. The format is made up of static strings (which may
include standard C character escapes for newlines, tabs, and other special characters) and
printf(3) type formatters. The list of type specifiers is as follows:
.RS 1.2i
.TP
\fBB\fR	Block size in bytes
.TP
\fBT\fR	Cluster size in bytes
.TP
\fBN\fR	Number of node slots
.TP
\fBR\fR	Root directory block number
.TP
\fBY\fR	System directory block number
.TP
\fBP\fR	First cluster group block number
.TP
\fBV\fR	Volume label
.TP
\fBU\fR	Volume uuid
.TP
\fBM\fR	Compat flags
.TP
\fBH\fR	Incompat flags
.TP
\fBO\fR	RO Compat flags
.RE

.TP
\fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fR
Quiet mode.

.TP
\fB\-U, \-\-uuid\-reset\fR[=\fInew-uuid]\fR
Set the volume UUID for the file system. If not provided, will auto generate a new UUID. The format of the provided UUID should be 178BDC83D50241EF94EB474A677D498B or 178BDC83-D502-41EF-94EB-474A677D498B.

.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR
Verbose mode.

.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Show version and exit.

.TP
\fB\-y, \-\-yes\fR
Always answer Yes in interactive command line.

.TP
\fB\-n, \-\-no\fR
Always answer No in interactive command line.

.TP
\fB\-\-backup\-super\fR
Backs up the superblock to fixed offsets (1G, 4G, 16G, 64G, 256G and 1T)
on disk. This option is useful for users to backup the superblock on volumes
that the user either explicitly disallowed while formatting, or, used a
version of \fImkfs.ocfs2\fR (1.2.2 or older) that did not provide this
facility.

.TP
\fB\-\-list-sparse\fR
Lists the files having holes. This option is useful when disabling the \fIsparse\fR feature.

.TP
\fB\-\-update-cluster-stack\fR
Updating on-disk cluster information to match the running cluster.

.TP
\fIblocks-count\fR
During resize, \fItunefs.ocfs2\fR automatically determines the size of the given
device and grows the file system such that it uses all of the available space on
the device. This optional argument specifies that the file system should be
extended to consume only the given number of file system blocks on the device.
