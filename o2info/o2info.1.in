.SH "NAME"
o2info \- Show \fIOCFS2\fR file system information.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBo2info\fR [\fB\-C|\-\-cluster\-coherent\fR] [\fB\-\-fs\-features\fR] [\fB\-\-volinfo\fR] [\fB\-\-mkfs\fR] [\fB\-\-freeinode\fR] [\fB\-\-freefrag\fR \fIchunksize\fR] [\fB\-\-space\-usage\fR] [\fB\-\-filestat\fR] <\fBdevice or file\fR>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBo2info\fR shows information about \fIOCFS2\fR file systems. It differs from \fBdebugfs.ocfs2(8)\fR
in that it allows users with limited read priviledges to query similar information. Users do not have
to have the read privilege on the device as is expected by \fBdebugfs.ocfs2(8)\fR. This utility allows
users to provide a path to an object on a mounted file system. The user needs to have the read priviledge
on that object.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-C, \-\-cluster\-coherent\fR
Force cluster coherency when querying a mounted file systems. The is disabled by default.
Enable this only if accurate information is required as it involves taking cluster locks.

.TP
\fB\-\-fs\-features\fR
Show all the file system features (compat, incompat, ro compat) enabled on the file system.

.TP
\fB\-\-volinfo\fR
Show file system information such as label, uuid, block and cluster sizes, node slots, etc.

.TP
\fB\-\-mkfs\fR
Show file system information in \fBmkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR format.

.TP
\fB\-\-freeinode\fR
Show the inode (allocated/free) count for all slots in the file system.

.TP
\fB\-\-freefrag\fR \fIchunksize\fR
Show the free space fragmentation of the file system. The chunksize should be equal to or
greater than the cluster size.

.TP
\fB\-\-space\-usage\fR
Show the disk space used by a file in block sized units. It also provides the block count
of the holes, shared extents and unwritten extents.

.TP
\fB\-\-filestat\fR
Show the extended \fBstat(1)\fR information that includes the number of clusters consumed
by extended attributes, unwritten extents, shared extents and holes, along with the file
fragmentation score.

.TP
\fB\-V, \-\-version\fR
Show version and exit.

.TP
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR
Show help and exit.

.SH "NOTE"
.PP
The utility uses custom info ioctls to query information from a mounted file system. As these
info ioctls were added starting in Linux kernel 2.6.37, this utility will not work on mounted
\fIOCFS2\fR file systems running on systems having older kernels.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
Non-priviledged users can query the volume information by providing the path to a file on
a mounted file system. Priviledged users can provide the path to the device.

The same goes for querying file system fragmentation.
