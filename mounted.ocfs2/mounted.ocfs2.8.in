.SH "NAME"
mounted.ocfs2 \- Detects all \fIOCFS2\fR volumes on a system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBmounted.ocfs2\fR [\fB\-d\fR] [\fB\-f\fR] [\fIdevice\fR]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBmounted.ocfs2\fR is used to detect \fIOCFS2\fR volume(s) on a system. When run without
specifying a \fIdevice\fR, it scans all the partitions listed in /proc/partitions.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Lists the \fIOCFS2\fR volumes along with their labels and uuids. It also lists the
cluster stack, cluster name and the cluster flags. The possible cluster stacks are
\fBo2cb\fR, \fBpcmk\fR and \fBcman\fR. \fBNone\fR indicates a local mount or a
non-clustered volume. A \fBG\fR cluster flag indicates \fIglobal-heartbeat\fR for
the \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Lists the \fIOCFS2\fR volumes along with the list of nodes that have mounted the
volume.

.SH "NOTES"
As this utility gathers information without taking any cluster locks, the information
listed in the full detect mode could be stale. This is only problematic for volumes that
were not cleanly umounted by the last node. Such volumes will show up mounted (as per
this utility) on one or more nodes but are in fact not mounted on any node. Such volumes
are awaiting slot-recovery which is auto-performed on the next mount (or file system check).
