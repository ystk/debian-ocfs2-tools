o2hbmonitor \- Monitors disk heartbeat in the O2CB cluster stack

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP 
\fBo2hbmonitor\fR is a utility to monitor the disk heartbeat in the \fBo2cb\fR
cluster stack. It tracks the time elapsed since the last heartbeat and logs messages
once it exceeds the warn threshold.

By default, it runs as a daemon and logs messages to the system logger. It can be
started at any time and stopped using \fBkill(1)\fR. It does not affect the functioning
of the heartbeat thread. It is typically automatically started during cluster online and
stopped during cluster offline by the \fIo2cb\fR init script.

This utility expects the \fBdebugfs\fR file system to be mounted at \fB/sys/kernel/debug\fR.
