<font size=+1>
<li>How do I get started?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the module and tools rpms.
<li>Create cluster.conf and propagate to all nodes.
<li>Configure and start the O2CB cluster service.
<li>Format the volume.
<li>Mount the volume.
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I know the version number running?<br>
</font>
<pre>
	# cat /proc/fs/ocfs2/version
	OCFS2 1.2.1 Fri Apr 21 13:51:24 PDT 2006 (build bd2f25ba0af9677db3572e3ccd92f739)
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I configure my system to auto-reboot after a panic?<br>
</font>
To auto-reboot system 60 secs after a panic, do:
<pre>
	# echo 60 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic
</pre>
To enable the above on every reboot, add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:
<pre>
	kernel.panic = 60
</pre>

<p>
<A name="DOWNLOAD"><font size=+1><b>DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Where do I get the packages from?<br>
</font>
For Oracle Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, use the up2date command as follows:
<pre>
	# up2date --install ocfs2-tools ocfs2console
	# up2date --install ocfs2-`uname -r`
</pre>
For Novell's SLES9, use yast to upgrade to the latest SP3 kernel to get the required
modules installed. Also, install the ocfs2-tools and ocfs2console packages.<br>
For Novell's SLES10, install ocfs2-tools and ocfs2console packages.</b>
For Red Hat's RHEL4 and RHEL5, download and install the appropriate module package and the two tools
packages, ocfs2-tools and ocfs2console. Appropriate module refers to one matching the
kernel version, flavor and architecture. Flavor refers to smp, hugemem, etc.<br>

<span style="color: #F00;">
<font size=+1>
<li>What are the latest versions of the OCFS2 packages?<br>
</font>
For Enterprise Linux 5, the latest module package version is 1.2.6-1 and the latest
tools/console package version is 1.2.6-1.<br>
For Enterprise Linux 4, the latest module package version is 1.2.5-1 and the latest
tools/console package version is 1.2.4-1.<br>
</span>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I interpret the package name ocfs2-2.6.9-22.0.1.ELsmp-1.2.1-1.i686.rpm?<br>
</font>
The package name is comprised of multiple parts separated by '-'.<br>
<ul>
<li><b>ocfs2</b> - Package name
<li><b>2.6.9-22.0.1.ELsmp</b> - Kernel version and flavor
<li><b>1.2.1</b> - Package version
<li><b>1</b> - Package subversion
<li><b>i686</b> - Architecture
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I know which package to install on my box?<br>
</font>
After one identifies the package name and version to install, one still needs
to determine the kernel version, flavor and architecture.<br>
To know the kernel version and flavor, do:
<pre>
	# uname -r
	2.6.9-22.0.1.ELsmp
</pre>
To know the architecture, do:
<pre>
	# rpm -qf /boot/vmlinuz-`uname -r` --queryformat "%{ARCH}\n"
	i686
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>Why can't I use <i>uname -p</i> to determine the kernel architecture?<br>
</font>
<i>uname -p</i> does not always provide the exact kernel architecture. Case in
point the RHEL3 kernels on x86_64. Even though Red Hat has two different kernel
architectures available for this port, ia32e and x86_64, <i>uname -p</i>
identifies both as the generic <i>x86_64</i>.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I install the rpms?<br>
</font>
First install the tools and console packages:
<pre>
	# rpm -Uvh ocfs2-tools-1.2.1-1.i386.rpm ocfs2console-1.2.1-1.i386.rpm
</pre>
Then install the appropriate kernel module package:
<pre>
	# rpm -Uvh ocfs2-2.6.9-22.0.1.ELsmp-1.2.1-1.i686.rpm
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>Do I need to install the console?<br>
</font>
No, the console is not required but recommended for ease-of-use.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What are the dependencies for installing ocfs2console?<br>
</font>
ocfs2console requires e2fsprogs, glib2 2.2.3 or later, vte 0.11.10 or later,
pygtk2 (RHEL4) or python-gtk (SLES9) 1.99.16 or later, python 2.3 or later and
ocfs2-tools.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What modules are installed with the OCFS2 1.2 package?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>ocfs2.ko
<li>ocfs2_dlm.ko
<li>ocfs2_dlmfs.ko
<li>ocfs2_nodemanager.ko
<li>configfs.ko (only Enterprise Linux 4)
<li>debugfs.ko (only Enterprise Linux 4)<br>
</ul>
<span style="color: #F00;">
The kernel shipped alongwith Enterprise Linux 5 includes configfs.ko and debugfs.ko.<br>
</span>

<font size=+1>
<li>What tools are installed with the ocfs2-tools 1.2 package?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>mkfs.ocfs2
<li>fsck.ocfs2
<li>tunefs.ocfs2
<li>debugfs.ocfs2
<li>mount.ocfs2
<li>mounted.ocfs2
<li>ocfs2cdsl
<li>ocfs2_hb_ctl
<li>o2cb_ctl
<li>o2cb - init service to start/stop the cluster
<li>ocfs2 - init service to mount/umount ocfs2 volumes
<li>ocfs2console - installed with the console package
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is debugfs and is it related to debugfs.ocfs2?<br>
</font>
<a href=http://kerneltrap.org/node/4394>debugfs</a> is an in-memory filesystem
developed by Greg Kroah-Hartman. It is useful for debugging as it allows kernel
space to easily export data to userspace. It is currently being used by OCFS2
to dump the list of filesystem locks and could be used for more in the future.
It is bundled with OCFS2 as the various distributions are currently not bundling
it. While debugfs and debugfs.ocfs2 are unrelated in general, the latter is used
as the front-end for the debugging info provided by the former. For example,
refer to the troubleshooting section.

<p>
<A name="CONFIGURE"><font size=+1><b>CONFIGURE</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I populate /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf?<br>
</font>
If you have installed the console, use it to create this configuration file.
For details, refer to the user's guide.  If you do not have the console installed,
check the Appendix in the User's guide for a sample cluster.conf and the details
of all the components. Do not forget to copy this file to all the nodes in the
cluster. If you ever edit this file on any node, ensure the other nodes are
updated as well.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Should the IP interconnect be public or private?<br>
</font>
Using a private interconnect is recommended. While OCFS2 does not take much
bandwidth, it does require the nodes to be alive on the network and sends regular
keepalive packets to ensure that they are. To avoid a network delay being
interpreted as a node disappearing on the net which could lead to a
node-self-fencing, a private interconnect is recommended. One could use the
same interconnect for Oracle RAC and OCFS2.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What should the node name be and should it be related to the IP address?<br>
</font>
The node name needs to match the hostname. The IP address need not be the one
associated with that hostname. As in, any valid IP address on that node can be
used. OCFS2 will not attempt to match the node name (hostname) with the
specified IP address.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I modify the IP address, port or any other information specified in cluster.conf?<br>
</font>
While one can use ocfs2console to add nodes dynamically to a running cluster,
any other modifications require the cluster to be offlined. Stop the cluster
on all nodes, edit /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf on one and copy to the rest, and
restart the cluster on all nodes. Always ensure that cluster.conf is the
same on all the nodes in the cluster.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I add a new node to an online cluster?<br>
</font>
You can use the console to add a new node. However, you will need to explicitly add
the new node on all the online nodes. That is, adding on one node and propagating
to the other nodes is not sufficient. If the operation fails, it will most likely
be due to <a href="http://oss.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=741">bug#741</a>.
In that case, you can use the o2cb_ctl utility on all online nodes as follows:
<pre>
	# o2cb_ctl -C -i -n NODENAME -t node -a number=NODENUM -a ip_address=IPADDR -a ip_port=IPPORT -a cluster=CLUSTERNAME
</pre>
Ensure the node is added both in /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf and in /config/cluster/CLUSTERNAME/node
on all online nodes. You can then simply copy the cluster.conf to the new (still offline) node
as well as other offline nodes. At the end, ensure that cluster.conf is consistent on all the nodes.

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I add a new node to an offline cluster?<br>
</font>
You can either use the console or use o2cb_ctl or simply hand edit cluster.conf. Then
either use the console to propagate it to all nodes or hand copy using scp or any other tool.
The o2cb_ctl command to do the same is:
<pre>
        # o2cb_ctl -C -n NODENAME -t node -a number=NODENUM -a ip_address=IPADDR -a ip_port=IPPORT -a cluster=CLUSTERNAME
</pre>
Notice the "-i" argument is not required as the cluster is not online.

<p>
<A name="O2CB"><font size=+1><b>O2CB CLUSTER SERVICE</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I configure the cluster service?<br>
</font>
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb configure
</pre>
Enter 'y' if you want the service to load on boot, the name of the
cluster (as listed in /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf) and the <a href=#TIMEOUT>cluster timeouts</a>.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I start the cluster service?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>To load the modules, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb load
</pre>
<li>To Online it, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb online [cluster_name]
</pre>
</ul>
If you have configured the cluster to load on boot, you could combine the two as follows:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb start [cluster_name]
</pre>
The cluster name is not required if you have specified the name during configuration.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I stop the cluster service?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>To offline it, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb offline [cluster_name]
</pre>
<li>To unload the modules, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb unload
</pre>
</ul>
If you have configured the cluster to load on boot, you could combine the two as follows:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb stop [cluster_name]
</pre>
The cluster name is not required if you have specified the name during configuration.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How can I learn the status of the cluster?<br>
</font>
To learn the status of the cluster, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb status
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>I am unable to get the cluster online. What could be wrong?<br>
</font>
Check whether the node name in the cluster.conf exactly matches the hostname.
One of the nodes in the cluster.conf need to be in the cluster for the cluster
to be online.<br>

<p>
<A name="FORMAT"><font size=+1><b>FORMAT</b></font></A>
</p>

<span style="color: #F00;">
<font size=+1>
<li>Should I partition a disk before formatting?<br>
</font>
Yes, partitioning is recommended even if one is planning to use the entire disk
for ocfs2. Apart from the fact that partitioned disks are less likely to be "reused"
by mistake, some features like mount-by-label only work with partitioned volumes.<br>
Use fdisk or parted or any other tool for the task.<br>
</span>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I format a volume?<br>
</font>
You could either use the console or use mkfs.ocfs2 directly to format the volume.
For console, refer to the user's guide.
<pre>
	# mkfs.ocfs2 -L "oracle_home" /dev/sdX
</pre>
The above formats the volume with default block and cluster sizes, which are computed
based upon the size of the volume.
<pre>
	# mkfs.ocfs2 -b 4k -C 32K -L "oracle_home" -N 4 /dev/sdX
</pre>
The above formats the volume for 4 nodes with a 4K block size and a 32K cluster size.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What does the number of node slots during format refer to?<br>
</font>
The number of node slots specifies the number of nodes that can concurrently mount
the volume. This number is specified during format and can be increased using
tunefs.ocfs2. This number cannot be decreased.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What should I consider when determining the number of node slots?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 allocates system files, like Journal, for each node slot. So as to not
to waste space, one should specify a number within the ballpark of the actual
number of nodes. Also, as this number can be increased, there is no need to
specify a much larger number than one plans for mounting the volume.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Does the number of node slots have to be the same for all volumes?<br>
</font>
No. This number can be different for each volume.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What block size should I use?<br>
</font>
A block size is the smallest unit of space addressable by the file system.
OCFS2 supports block sizes of 512 bytes, 1K, 2K and 4K. The block size cannot
be changed after the format. For most volume sizes, a 4K size is recommended.
On the other hand, the 512 bytes block is never recommended.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What cluster size should I use?<br>
</font>
A cluster size is the smallest unit of space allocated to a file to hold the data.
OCFS2 supports cluster sizes of 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, 512K and 1M.
For database volumes, a cluster size of 128K or larger is recommended. For Oracle
home, 32K to 64K.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Any advantage of labelling the volumes?<br>
</font>
As in a shared disk environment, the disk name (/dev/sdX) for a particular device
be different on different nodes, labelling becomes a must for easy identification.
You could also use labels to identify volumes during mount.
<pre>
	# mount -L "label" /dir
</pre>
The volume label is changeable using the tunefs.ocfs2 utility.<br>

<p>
<A name="RESIZE"><font size=+1><b>RESIZE</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can OCFS2 file systems be grown in size?<br>
</font>
Yes, you can grow an OCFS2 file system using tunefs.ocfs2. It should be noted that
the tool will only resize the file system and not the underlying partition. You can
use <i>fdisk(8)</i> (or any appropriate tool for your disk array) to resize the partition.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What do I need to know to use fdisk(8) to resize the partition?<br>
</font>
To grow a partition using <i>fdisk(8)</i>, you will have to delete it and recreate it
with a larger size. When recreating it, ensure you specify the same starting disk cylinder
as before and a ending disk cylinder that is greater than the existing one. Otherwise,
not only will the resize operation fail, but you may lose your entire file system. Backup
your data before performing this task.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Short of reboot, how do I get the other nodes in the cluster to see the resized partition?<br>
</font>
Use <i>blockdev(8)</i> to rescan the partition table of the device on the other nodes in
the cluster.
<pre>
	# blockdev --rereadpt /dev/sdX
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is the tunefs.ocfs2 syntax for resizing the file system?<br>
</font>
To grow a file system to the end of the resized partition, do:
<pre>
	# tunefs.ocfs2 -S /dev/sdX
</pre>
For more, refer to the tunefs.ocfs2 manpage.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can the OCFS2 file system be grown while the file system is in use?<br>
</font>
No. tunefs.ocfs2 1.2.2 only allows offline resize. i.e., the file system cannot
be mounted on any node in the cluster. The online resize capability will be added later.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can the OCFS2 file system be shrunk in size?<br>
</font>
No. We have no current plans on providing this functionality. However, if you find this
feature useful, file an enhancement request on bugzilla listing your reasons for the same.<br>

<p>
<A name="MOUNT"><font size=+1><b>MOUNT</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I mount the volume?<br>
</font>
You could either use the console or use mount directly. For console, refer to
the user's guide.
<pre>
	# mount -t ocfs2 /dev/sdX /dir
</pre>
The above command will mount device /dev/sdX on directory /dir.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I mount by label?<br>
</font>
To mount by label do:
<pre>
	# mount -L "label" /dir
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>What entry to I add to /etc/fstab to mount an ocfs2 volume?<br>
</font>
Add the following:
<pre>
	/dev/sdX	/dir	ocfs2	noauto,_netdev	0	0
</pre>
The _netdev option indicates that the devices needs to be mounted after the network is up.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What do I need to do to mount OCFS2 volumes on boot?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>Enable o2cb service using:
<pre>
	# chkconfig --add o2cb
</pre>
<li>Enable ocfs2 service using:
<pre>
	# chkconfig --add ocfs2
</pre>
<li>Configure o2cb to load on boot using:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb configure
</pre>
<li>Add entries into /etc/fstab as follows:
<pre>
	/dev/sdX	/dir	ocfs2	_netdev	0	0
</pre>
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I know my volume is mounted?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>Enter mount without arguments, or,
<pre>
	# mount
</pre>
<li>List /etc/mtab, or,
<pre>
	# cat /etc/mtab
</pre>
<li>List /proc/mounts, or,
<pre>
	# cat /proc/mounts
</pre>
<li>Run ocfs2 service.
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/ocfs2 status
</pre>
mount command reads the /etc/mtab to show the information.<br>
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>What are the /config and /dlm mountpoints for?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 comes bundled with two in-memory filesystems <i>configfs</i> and <i>ocfs2_dlmfs</i>.
<i>configfs</i> is used by the ocfs2 tools to communicate to the in-kernel node
manager the list of nodes in the cluster and to the in-kernel heartbeat thread
the resource to heartbeat on. <i>ocfs2_dlmfs</i> is used by ocfs2 tools to communicate
with the in-kernel dlm to take and release clusterwide locks on resources.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Why does it take so much time to mount the volume?<br>
</font>
It takes around 5 secs for a volume to mount. It does so so as to let the heartbeat
thread stabilize. In a later release, we plan to add support for a global
heartbeat, which will make most mounts instant.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Why does it take so much time to umount the volume?<br>
</font>
During umount, the dlm has to migrate all the mastered lockres' to an another
node in the cluster. In 1.2, the lockres migration is a synchronous operation.
We are looking into making it asynchronous so as to reduce the time it takes
to migrate the lockres'. (While we have improved this performance in 1.2.5, the
task of asynchronously migrating lockres' has been pushed to the 1.4 time frame.)

To find the number of lockres in all dlm domains, do:
<pre>
	# cat /proc/fs/ocfs2_dlm/*/stat
	local=60624, remote=1, unknown=0, key=0x8619a8da
</pre>
<i>local</i> refers to locally mastered lockres'.
</br>

<p>
<A name="RAC"><font size=+1><b>ORACLE RAC</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Any special flags to run Oracle RAC?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 volumes containing the Voting diskfile (CRS), Cluster registry (OCR),
Data files, Redo logs, Archive logs and Control files must be mounted with the
<b><i>datavolume</i></b> and <b><i>nointr</i></b> mount options. The <i>datavolume</i>
option ensures that the Oracle processes opens these files with the o_direct flag.
The <i>nointr</i> option ensures that the ios are not interrupted by signals.
<pre>
	# mount -o datavolume,nointr -t ocfs2 /dev/sda1 /u01/db
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>What about the volume containing Oracle home?<br>
</font>
Oracle home volume should be mounted normally, that is, without the <i>datavolume</i>
and <i>nointr</i> mount options. These mount options are only relevant for Oracle
files listed above.
<pre>
	# mount -t ocfs2 /dev/sdb1 /software/orahome
</pre>
Also as OCFS2 does not currently support shared writeable mmap, the health check (GIMH)
file <i>$ORACLE_HOME/dbs/hc_ORACLESID.dat</i> and the ASM file <i>$ASM_HOME/dbs/ab_ORACLESID.dat</i>
should be symlinked to local filesystem. We expect to support shared writeable mmap in the
OCFS2 1.4 release.

<font size=+1>
<li>Does that mean I cannot have my data file and Oracle home on the same volume?<br>
</font>
Yes. The volume containing the Oracle data files, redo-logs, etc. should never
be on the same volume as the distribution (including the trace logs like,
alert.log).<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Any other information I should be aware off?<br>
</font>
The 1.2.3 release of OCFS2 does not update the modification time on the inode
across the cluster for non-extending writes. However, the time will be locally
updated in the cached inodes. This leads to one observing different times (ls -l)
for the same file on different nodes on the cluster.<br>
While this does not affect most uses of the filesystem, as one variably changes the
file size during write, the one usage where this is most commonly experienced is with
Oracle datafiles and redologs. This is because Oracle rarely resizes these files and
thus almost all writes are non-extending.<br>
In OCFS2 1.4, we intend to fix this by updating modification times for all writes
while providing an opt-out mount option (nocmtime) for users who would prefer
to avoid the performance overhead associated with this feature.<br>

<p>
<A name="MIGRATE"><font size=+1><b>MIGRATE DATA FROM OCFS (RELEASE 1) TO OCFS2</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can I mount OCFS volumes as OCFS2?<br>
</font>
No. OCFS and OCFS2 are not on-disk compatible. We had to break the compatibility
in order to add many of the new features. At the same time, we have added enough
flexibility in the new disk layout so as to maintain backward compatibility
in the future.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can OCFS volumes and OCFS2 volumes be mounted on the same machine simultaneously?<br>
</font>
No. OCFS only works on 2.4 linux kernels (Red Hat's AS2.1/EL3 and SuSE's SLES8).
OCFS2, on the other hand, only works on the 2.6 kernels (RHEL4, SLES9 and SLES10).<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can I access my OCFS volume on 2.6 kernels (SLES9/SLES10/RHEL4)?<br>
</font>
Yes, you can access the OCFS volume on 2.6 kernels using FSCat tools, fsls and
fscp. These tools can access the OCFS volumes at the device layer, to list and
copy the files to another filesystem.  FSCat tools are available on oss.oracle.com.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can I in-place convert my OCFS volume to OCFS2?<br>
</font>
No. The on-disk layout of OCFS and OCFS2 are sufficiently different that it
would require a third disk (as a temporary buffer) inorder to in-place upgrade
the volume. With that in mind, it was decided not to develop such a tool but
instead provide tools to copy data from OCFS without one having to mount it.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is the quickest way to move data from OCFS to OCFS2?<br>
</font>
Quickest would mean having to perform the minimal number of copies. If you have
the current backup on a non-OCFS volume accessible from the 2.6 kernel install,
then all you would need to do is to retore the backup on the OCFS2 volume(s).
If you do not have a backup but have a setup in which the system containing the
OCFS2 volumes can access the disks containing the OCFS volume, you can use the
FSCat tools to extract data from the OCFS volume and copy onto OCFS2.<br>

<li>Like with OCFS (Release 1), do I need to use o_direct enabled tools to
perform cp, mv, tar, etc.?<br>
</font>
No. OCFS2 does not need the o_direct enabled tools. The file system allows
processes to open files in both o_direct and bufferred mode concurrently.<br>

<p>
<A name="NFS"><font size=+1><b>EXPORTING VIA NFS</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can I export an OCFS2 file system via NFS?<br>
</font>
Yes, you can export files on OCFS2 via the standard Linux NFS server. Please
note that only NFS version 3 and above will work. In practice, this means
clients need to be running a 2.4.x kernel or above.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Is there no solution for the NFS v2 clients?<br>
</font>
NFS v2 clients can work if the server exports the volumes with the
<i>no_subtree_check</i> option. However, this has some security implications
that is documented in the <i>exports</i> manpage.<br>

<li>How do I enable and disable filesystem tracing?<br>
</font>
To list all the debug bits along with their statuses, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l
</pre>
To enable tracing the bit SUPER, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l SUPER allow
</pre>
To disable tracing the bit SUPER, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l SUPER off
</pre>
To totally turn off tracing the SUPER bit, as in, turn off tracing even if
some other bit is enabled for the same, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l SUPER deny
</pre>
To enable heartbeat tracing, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l HEARTBEAT ENTRY EXIT allow
</pre>
To disable heartbeat tracing, do:
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -l HEARTBEAT off ENTRY EXIT deny
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I get a list of filesystem locks and their statuses?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 1.0.9+ has this feature. To get this list, do:
<ul>
<li>Mount debugfs is mounted at /debug (EL4) or /sys/kernel/debug (EL5).
<pre>
	# mount -t debugfs debugfs /debug
	- OR -
	# mount -t debugfs debugfs /sys/kernel/debug
</pre>
<li>Dump the locks.
<pre>
	# echo "fs_locks" | debugfs.ocfs2 /dev/sdX >/tmp/fslocks
</pre>
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I read the fs_locks output?<br>
</font>
Let's look at a sample output:
<pre>
	Lockres: M000000000000000006672078b84822  Mode: Protected Read
	Flags: Initialized Attached
	RO Holders: 0  EX Holders: 0
	Pending Action: None  Pending Unlock Action: None
	Requested Mode: Protected Read  Blocking Mode: Invalid
</pre>
First thing to note is the Lockres, which is the lockname. The dlm identifies
resources using locknames. A lockname is a combination of a lock type
(S superblock, M metadata, D filedata, R rename, W readwrite), inode number
and generation.<br>
To get the inode number and generation from lockname, do:
<pre>
	#echo "stat <M000000000000000006672078b84822>" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
	Inode: 419616   Mode: 0666   Generation: 2025343010 (0x78b84822)
	....
</pre>
To map the lockname to a directory entry, do:
<pre>
	# echo "locate <M000000000000000006672078b84822>" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
	419616  /linux-2.6.15/arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c
</pre>
One could also provide the inode number instead of the lockname.
<pre>
	# echo "locate <419616>" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
	419616  /linux-2.6.15/arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c
</pre>
To get a lockname from a directory entry, do:
<pre>
	# echo "encode /linux-2.6.15/arch/i386/kernel/semaphore.c" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
	M000000000000000006672078b84822 D000000000000000006672078b84822 W000000000000000006672078b84822
</pre>
The first is the Metadata lock, then Data lock and last ReadWrite lock for the same resource.<br>
<br>
The DLM supports 3 lock modes: NL no lock, PR protected read and EX exclusive.<br>
<br>
If you have a dlm hang, the resource to look for would be one with the "Busy" flag set.<br>
<br>
The next step would be to query the dlm for the lock resource.<br>
<br>
Note: The dlm debugging is still a work in progress.<br>
<br>
To do dlm debugging, first one needs to know the dlm domain, which matches
the volume UUID.
<pre>
	# echo "stats" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX | grep UUID: | while read a b ; do echo $b ; done
	82DA8137A49A47E4B187F74E09FBBB4B
</pre>
Then do:
<pre>
	# echo R dlm_domain lockname > /proc/fs/ocfs2_dlm/debug
</pre>
For example:
<pre>
	# echo R 82DA8137A49A47E4B187F74E09FBBB4B M000000000000000006672078b84822 > /proc/fs/ocfs2_dlm/debug
	# dmesg | tail
	struct dlm_ctxt: 82DA8137A49A47E4B187F74E09FBBB4B, node=79, key=965960985
	lockres: M000000000000000006672078b84822, owner=75, state=0 last used: 0, on purge list: no
	  granted queue:
	    type=3, conv=-1, node=79, cookie=11673330234144325711, ast=(empty=y,pend=n), bast=(empty=y,pend=n)
	  converting queue:
	  blocked queue:
</pre>
It shows that the lock is mastered by node 75 and that node 79 has been granted
a PR lock on the resource.<br>
<br>
This is just to give a flavor of dlm debugging.<br>

<p>
<A name="LIMITS"><font size=+1><b>LIMITS</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Is there a limit to the number of subdirectories in a directory?<br>
</font>
Yes. OCFS2 currently allows up to 32000 subdirectories. While this limit could
be increased, we will not be doing it till we implement some kind of efficient
name lookup (htree, etc.).<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Is there a limit to the size of an ocfs2 file system?<br>
</font>
Yes, current software addresses block numbers with 32 bits. So the file system
device is limited to (2 ^ 32) * blocksize (see mkfs -b). With a 4KB block size
this amounts to a 16TB file system. This block addressing limit will be relaxed
in future software. At that point the limit becomes addressing clusters of 1MB
each with 32 bits which leads to a 4PB file system.<br>

<p>
<A name="SYSTEMFILES"><font size=+1><b>SYSTEM FILES</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>What are system files?<br>
</font>
System files are used to store standard filesystem metadata like bitmaps,
journals, etc. Storing this information in files in a directory allows OCFS2
to be extensible. These system files can be accessed using debugfs.ocfs2.
To list the system files, do:<br>
<pre>
	# echo "ls -l //" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
        	18        16       1      2  .
        	18        16       2      2  ..
        	19        24       10     1  bad_blocks
        	20        32       18     1  global_inode_alloc
        	21        20       8      1  slot_map
        	22        24       9      1  heartbeat
        	23        28       13     1  global_bitmap
        	24        28       15     2  orphan_dir:0000
        	25        32       17     1  extent_alloc:0000
        	26        28       16     1  inode_alloc:0000
        	27        24       12     1  journal:0000
        	28        28       16     1  local_alloc:0000
        	29        3796     17     1  truncate_log:0000
</pre>
The first column lists the block number.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Why do some files have numbers at the end?<br>
</font>
There are two types of files, global and local. Global files are for all the
nodes, while local, like journal:0000, are node specific. The set of local
files used by a node is determined by the slot mapping of that node. The
numbers at the end of the system file name is the slot#. To list the slot maps, do:<br>
<pre>
	# echo "slotmap" | debugfs.ocfs2 -n /dev/sdX
       	Slot#   Node#
            0      39
       	    1      40
            2      41
       	    3      42
</pre>

<p>
<A name="HEARTBEAT"><font size=+1><b>HEARTBEAT</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does the disk heartbeat work?<br>
</font>
Every node writes every two secs to its block in the heartbeat system file.
The block offset is equal to its global node number. So node 0 writes to the
first block, node 1 to the second, etc. All the nodes also read the heartbeat
sysfile every two secs. As long as the timestamp is changing, that node is
deemed alive.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>When is a node deemed dead?<br>
</font>
An active node is deemed dead if it does not update its timestamp for
O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD (default=7) loops. Once a node is deemed dead, the
surviving node which manages to cluster lock the dead node's journal, recovers
it by replaying the journal.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What about self fencing?<br>
</font>
A node self-fences if it fails to update its timestamp for
((O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD - 1) * 2) secs. The [o2hb-xx] kernel thread, after
every timestamp write, sets a timer to panic the system after that duration.
If the next timestamp is written within that duration, as it should, it first
cancels that timer before setting up a new one. This way it ensures the system
will self fence if for some reason the [o2hb-x] kernel thread is unable to
update the timestamp and thus be deemed dead by other nodes in the cluster.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How can one change the parameter value of O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD?<br>
</font>
This parameter value could be changed by adding it to /etc/sysconfig/o2cb and
RESTARTING the O2CB cluster. This value should be the SAME on ALL the nodes
in the cluster.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>What should one set O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD to?<br>
</font>
It should be set to the timeout value of the io layer. Most multipath solutions
have a timeout ranging from 60 secs to 120 secs. For 60 secs, set it to 31.
For 120 secs, set it to 61.<br>
<pre>
	O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD = (((timeout in secs) / 2) + 1)
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does one check the current active O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD value?<br>
</font>
<pre>
	# cat /proc/fs/ocfs2_nodemanager/hb_dead_threshold
	7
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>What if a node umounts a volume?<br>
</font>
During umount, the node will broadcast to all the nodes that have mounted that
volume to drop that node from its node maps. As the journal is shutdown before
this broadcast, any node crash after this point is ignored as there is no need
for recovery.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>I encounter "Kernel panic - not syncing: ocfs2 is very sorry to be fencing
this system by panicing" whenever I run a heavy io load?<br>
</font>
We have encountered a bug with the default <i>CFQ</i> io scheduler which causes
a process doing heavy io to temporarily starve out other processes. While this
is not fatal for most environments, it is for OCFS2 as we expect the hb thread
to reading from and writing to the hb area atleast once every 12 secs (default).
<span style="color: #F00;">This bug has been addressed by Red Hat in RHEL4 U4 (2.6.9-42.EL) and Novell
in SLES9 SP3 (2.6.5-7.257).</span> If you wish to use the <i>DEADLINE</i> io
scheduler, you could do so by appending "elevator=deadline" to the kernel
command line as follows:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>For SLES9, edit the command line in /boot/grub/menu.lst.
<pre>

<p>
<A name="QUORUM"><font size=+1><b>QUORUM AND FENCING</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is a quorum?<br>
</font>
A quorum is a designation given to a group of nodes in a cluster which are
still allowed to operate on shared storage. It comes up when there is a
failure in the cluster which breaks the nodes up into groups which can
communicate in their groups and with the shared storage but not between groups.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does OCFS2's cluster services define a quorum? 
</font>
The quorum decision is made by a single node based on the number of other nodes
that are considered alive by heartbeating and the number of other nodes that are
reachable via the network.<br>
A node has quorum when:<br>
<ul>
<li>it sees an odd number of heartbeating nodes and has network connectivity to
more than half of them.<br>
OR,<br>
<li>it sees an even number of heartbeating nodes and has network connectivity
to at least half of them *and* has connectivity to the heartbeating node with
the lowest node number.<br>
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is fencing?<br>
</font>
Fencing is the act of forecefully removing a node from a cluster. A node with
OCFS2 mounted will fence itself when it realizes that it doesn't have quorum
in a degraded cluster.  It does this so that other nodes won't get stuck trying
to access its resources. Currently OCFS2 will panic the machine when it
realizes it has to fence itself off from the cluster. As described above, it
will do this when it sees more nodes heartbeating than it has connectivity to
and fails the quorum test.<br>
<span style="color: #F00;">
Due to user reports of nodes hanging during fencing, OCFS2 1.2.5 no longer uses
"panic" for fencing. Instead, by default, it uses "machine restart".
This should not only prevent nodes from hanging during fencing but also allow
for nodes to quickly restart and rejoin the cluster. While this change is internal
in nature, we are documenting this so as to make users aware that they are no longer
going to see the familiar panic stack trace during fencing. Instead they will see the
message <i>"*** ocfs2 is very sorry to be fencing this system by restarting ***"</i>
and that too probably only as part of the messages captured on the netdump/netconsole
server.<br>
If perchance the user wishes to use panic to fence (maybe to see the familiar oops
stack trace or on the advise of customer support to diagnose frequent reboots),
one can do so by issuing the following command after the O2CB cluster is online.
<pre>
	# echo 1 > /proc/fs/ocfs2_nodemanager/fence_method
</pre>
Please note that this change is local to a node.
</span>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does a node decide that it has connectivity with another?<br>
</font>
When a node sees another come to life via heartbeating it will try and establish
a TCP connection to that newly live node. It considers that other node
connected as long as the TCP connection persists and the connection is not idle
for 10 seconds. Once that TCP connection is closed or idle it will not be
reestablished until heartbeat thinks the other node has died and come back alive.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How long does the quorum process take?<br>
</font>
First a node will realize that it doesn't have connectivity with another node.
This can happen immediately if the connection is closed but can take a maximum
of 10 seconds of idle time. Then the node must wait long enough to give
heartbeating a chance to declare the node dead. It does this by waiting two
iterations longer than the number of iterations needed to consider a node dead
(see the Heartbeat section of this FAQ). The current default of 7 iterations
of 2 seconds results in waiting for 9 iterations or 18 seconds. By default,
then, a maximum of 28 seconds can pass from the time a network fault occurs
until a node fences itself.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How can one avoid a node from panic-ing when one shutdowns the other node
in a 2-node cluster?<br>
</font>
This typically means that the network is shutting down before all the OCFS2 volumes
are being umounted. Ensure the ocfs2 init script is enabled. This script ensures
that the OCFS2 volumes are umounted before the network is shutdown. To check whether
the service is enabled, do:
<pre>
       	# chkconfig --list ocfs2
       	ocfs2     0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does one list out the startup and shutdown ordering of the OCFS2 related
services?<br>
</font>
<ul>
<li>To list the startup order for runlevel 3 on RHEL4, do:
<pre>
	# cd /etc/rc3.d
	# ls S*ocfs2* S*o2cb* S*network*
	S10network  S24o2cb  S25ocfs2
</pre>
<li>To list the shutdown order on RHEL4, do:
<pre>
	# cd /etc/rc6.d
	# ls K*ocfs2* K*o2cb* K*network*
	K19ocfs2  K20o2cb  K90network
</pre>
<li>To list the startup order for runlevel 3 on SLES9/SLES10, do:
<pre>
	# cd /etc/init.d/rc3.d
	# ls S*ocfs2* S*o2cb* S*network*
	S05network  S07o2cb  S08ocfs2
</pre>
<li>To list the shutdown order on SLES9/SLES10, do:
<pre>
	# cd /etc/init.d/rc3.d
	# ls K*ocfs2* K*o2cb* K*network*
	K14ocfs2  K15o2cb  K17network
</pre>
</ul>
Please note that the default ordering in the ocfs2 scripts only include the
network service and not any shared-device specific service, like iscsi. If one
is using iscsi or any shared device requiring a service to be started and
shutdown, please ensure that that service runs before and shutsdown after the
ocfs2 init service.<br>

</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>Why are OCFS2 packages for SLES9 and SLES10 not made available on oss.oracle.com?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 packages for SLES9 and SELS10 are available directly from Novell as part of the
kernel. Same is true for the various Asianux distributions and for ubuntu.
As OCFS2 is now part of the
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/166954/">mainline kernel</a>, we expect more

<font size=+1>
<li>What versions of OCFS2 are available with SLES9 and how do they match with
the Red Hat versions available on oss.oracle.com?<br>
</font>
As both Novell and Oracle ship OCFS2 on different schedules, the package versions
do not match. We expect to resolve itself over time as the number of patch
fixes reduce. Novell is shipping two SLES9 releases, viz., SP2 and SP3.<br>
<ul>
<li>The latest kernel with the SP2 release is 2.6.5-7.202.7. It ships with OCFS2 1.0.8.

<A name="RELEASE1.2"><font size=+1><b>RELEASE 1.2</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is new in OCFS2 1.2?<br>
</font>
OCFS2 1.2 has two new features:
<ul>
<li>It is endian-safe. With this release, one can mount the same volume concurrently
on x86, x86-64, ia64 and big endian architectures ppc64 and s390x.
<li>Supports readonly mounts. The fs uses this feature to auto remount ro when
encountering on-disk corruptions (instead of panic-ing).
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>Do I need to re-make the volume when upgrading?<br>
</font>
No. OCFS2 1.2 is fully on-disk compatible with 1.0.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Do I need to upgrade anything else?<br>
</font>
Yes, the tools needs to be upgraded to ocfs2-tools 1.2. ocfs2-tools 1.0 will

	# chkconfig --list o2cb
	o2cb      0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
	# chkconfig --list ocfs2
	ocfs2     0:off   1:off   2:on    3:on    4:on    5:on    6:off
</pre>
<li>To update the cluster timeouts, do:
<pre>
	# /etc/init.d/o2cb configure

<li>At this stage one could either reboot the node or simply, restart the cluster
and mount the volume.
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can I do a rolling upgrade from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4?<br>
</font>
No. The network protocol had to be updated in 1.2.4 to allow for
proper reference counting of lockres' across the cluster. This fix
was necessary to fix races encountered during lockres purge and migrate.
Effectively, one cannot run 1.2.4 on one node while another node
is still on an earlier release (1.2.3 or older).
<br>
</span>

<span style="color: #F00;">
<font size=+1>
<li>Can I do a rolling upgrade from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5?<br>
</font>
No. The network protocol had to be updated in 1.2.5 to ensure all nodes were
using the same O2CB timeouts. Effectively, one cannot run 1.2.5 on one node
while another node is still on an earlier release. (For the record, the
protocol remained the same between 1.2.0 to 1.2.3 before changing in 1.2.4
and 1.2.5.)
</span>

<font size=+1>
<li>After upgrade I am getting the following error on mount "mount.ocfs2: Invalid argument while mounting /dev/sda6 on /ocfs".<br>
</font>
Do "dmesg | tail". If you see the error:
<pre>
ocfs2_parse_options:523 ERROR: Unrecognized mount option "heartbeat=local" or missing value
</pre>
it means that you are trying to use the 1.2 tools and 1.0 modules. Ensure that you
have unloaded the 1.0 modules and installed and loaded the 1.2 modules. Use modinfo
to determine the version of the module installed and/or loaded.<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>The cluster fails to load. What do I do?<br>
</font>
Check "demsg | tail" for any relevant errors. One common error is as follows:
<pre>
SELinux: initialized (dev configfs, type configfs), not configured for labeling audit(1139964740.184:2): avc:  denied  { mount } for  ...
</pre>
The above error indicates that you have SELinux activated. A bug in SELinux
does not allow configfs to mount. Disable SELinux by setting "SELINUX=disabled"
in /etc/selinux/config. Change is activated on reboot.<br>

<A name="PROCESSES"><font size=+1><b>PROCESSES</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>List and describe all OCFS2 threads?<br>
</font>
<dl>

<dt>[o2net]
<dd>One per node. Is a workqueue thread started when the cluster is brought
online and stopped when offline. It handles the network communication for all
threads. It gets the list of active nodes from the o2hb thread and sets up
tcp/ip communication channels with each active node. It sends regular keepalive
packets to detect any interruption on the channels.

<dt>[user_dlm]
<dd>One per node. Is a workqueue thread started when dlmfs is loaded and stopped
on unload. (dlmfs is an in-memory file system which allows user space processes
to access the dlm in kernel to lock and unlock resources.) Handles lock downconverts
when requested by other nodes.

<dt>[ocfs2_wq]
<dd>One per node. Is a workqueue thread started when ocfs2 module is loaded
and stopped on unload. Handles blockable file system tasks like truncate
log flush, orphan dir recovery and local alloc recovery, which involve taking
dlm locks. Various code paths queue tasks to this thread. For example,
ocfs2rec queues orphan dir recovery so that while the task is kicked off as
part of recovery, its completion does not affect the recovery time.

<dt>[o2hb-14C29A7392]
<dd>One per heartbeat device. Is a kernel thread started when the heartbeat
region is populated in configfs and stopped when it is removed. It writes
every 2 secs to its block in the heartbeat region to indicate to other nodes
that that node is alive. It also reads the region to maintain a nodemap of
live nodes. It notifies o2net and dlm any changes in the nodemap.

<dt>[ocfs2vote-0]
<dd>One per mount. Is a kernel thread started when a volume is mounted and
stopped on umount. It downgrades locks when requested by other nodes in reponse
to blocking ASTs (BASTs). It also fixes up the dentry cache in reponse to
files unlinked or renamed on other nodes.

<dt>[dlm_thread]
<dd>One per dlm domain. Is a kernel thread started when a dlm domain is created
and stopped when destroyed. This is the core dlm which maintains the list of
lock resources and handles the cluster locking infrastructure.

<dt>[dlm_reco_thread]
<dd>One per dlm domain. Is a kernel thread which handles dlm recovery whenever
a node dies. If the node is the dlm recovery master, it remasters all the locks
owned by the dead node.

<dt>[dlm_wq]
<dd>One per dlm domain. Is a workqueue thread. o2net queues dlm tasks on this thread.

<dt>[kjournald]
<dd>One per mount. Is used as OCFS2 uses JDB for journalling.

<dt>[ocfs2cmt-0]
<dd>One per mount. Is a kernel thread started when a volume is mounted and
stopped on umount. Works in conjunction with kjournald.

<dt>[ocfs2rec-0]
<dd>Is started whenever another node needs to be be recovered. This could be
either on mount when it discovers a dirty journal or during operation when hb
detects a dead node. ocfs2rec handles the file system recovery and it runs
after the dlm has finished its recovery.

<p>
<A name="BACKUPSB"><font size=+1><b>BACKUP SUPER BLOCK</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>What is a Backup Super block?
</font>
A backup super block is a copy of the super block. As the super block is
typically located close to the start of the device, it is susceptible to
be overwritten, say, by an errant write (dd if=file of=/dev/sdX). Moreover,
as the super block stores critical information that is hard to recreate,
it becomes important to backup the block and use it when the super block
gets corrupted.
<br>
 
<font size=+1>
<li>Where are the backup super blocks located?
</font>
In OCFS2, the super blocks are backed up to blocks at the 1G, 4G, 16G, 64G,
256G and 1T byte offsets. The actual number of backups depend on the size
of the device. It should be noted that the super block is not backed up on
devices smaller than 1G.
<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How does one enable this feature?
</font>
mkfs.ocfs2 1.2.3 or later automatically backs up super blocks on devices
larger than 1G. One can disable this by using the --no-backup-super option.
<br>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I detect whether the super blocks are backed up on a device?
</font>
<pre>
	# debugfs.ocfs2 -R "stats" /dev/sdX | grep "Feature Compat"
        	Feature Compat: 1 BackupSuper
</pre>

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I backup the super block on a device formatted by an older mkfs.ocfs2?
</font>
tunefs.ocfs2 1.2.3 or later can attempt to retroactively backup the super block.
<pre>
	# tunefs.ocfs2 --backup-super /dev/sdX
	tunefs.ocfs2 1.2.3
	Adding backup superblock for the volume
	Proceed (y/N): y
	Backed up Superblock.
	Wrote Superblock
</pre>
However, it is quite possible that one or more backup locations are in use
by the file system. (tunefs.ocfs2 backs up the block only if all the backup
locations are unused.)
<pre>
	# tunefs.ocfs2 --backup-super /dev/sdX
	tunefs.ocfs2 1.2.3
	tunefs.ocfs2: block 262144 is in use.
	tunefs.ocfs2: block 4194304 is in use.
	tunefs.ocfs2: Cannot enable backup superblock as backup blocks are in use
</pre>
If so, use the
<a href=http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/dist/files/extras/verify_backup_super>verify_backup_super</a>
script to list out the objects using these blocks.
<pre>
	# ./verify_backup_super /dev/sdX
	Locating inodes using blocks 262144 1048576 4194304 on device /dev/sdX
        	Block#            Inode             Block Offset   
        	262144            27                65058          
        	1048576           Unused                           
        	4194304           4161791           25             
	Matching inodes to object names
        	27      //journal:0003
        	4161791 /src/kernel/linux-2.6.19/drivers/scsi/BusLogic.c
</pre>
If the object happens to be user created, move that object temporarily to an
another volume before re-attempting the operation. However, this will not work
if one or more blocks are being used by a system file (shown starting with
double slashes //), say, a journal.

<font size=+1>
<li>How do I ask fsck.ocfs2 to use a backup super block?
</font>
To recover a volume using the second backup super block, do:

	# fsck.ocfs2 -f -r 2 /dev/sdX
	[RECOVER_BACKUP_SUPERBLOCK] Recover superblock information from backup block#1048576? <n> n

<A name="TIMEOUT"><font size=+1><b>CONFIGURING CLUSTER TIMEOUTS</b></font></A>
</p>

<font size=+1>
<li>List and describe all the configurable timeouts in the O2CB cluster stack?
</font>
OCFS2 1.2.5 has 4 different configurable O2CB cluster timeouts:
<ul>
<li><b>O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD</b> - The Disk Heartbeat timeout is the number of two
second iterations before a node is considered dead. The exact formula used to
convert the timeout in seconds to the number of iterations is as follows:
<pre>
        O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD = (((timeout in seconds) / 2) + 1)
</pre>
For e.g., to specify a 60 sec timeout, set it to 31. For 120 secs, set it to 61.
The default is 12 secs (O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD = 7).

<li><b>O2CB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS</b> - The Network Idle timeout specifies the time in miliseconds
before a network connection is considered dead. The default is 10000 ms.

<li><b>O2CB_KEEPALIVE_DELAY_MS</b> - The Network Keepalive specifies the maximum
delay in miliseconds before a keepalive packet is sent. As in, a keepalive packet
is sent if a network connection between two nodes is silent for this duration.
If the other node is alive and is connected, it is expected to respond. The default
is 5000 ms.

<li><b>O2CB_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS</b> - The Network Reconnect specifies the minimum
delay in miliseconds between connection attempts. The default is 2000 ms.
</ul>

<font size=+1>
<li>What are the recommended timeout values?
</font>
As timeout values depend on the hardware being used, there is no one set
of recommended values. For e.g., users of multipath io should set the disk
heartbeat threshold to atleast 60 secs, if not 120 secs. Similarly, users of
Network bonding should set the network idle timeout to atleast 30 secs, if
not 60 secs.

<font size=+1>
<li>What were the timeouts set to during OCFS2 1.2.5 release testing?
</font>
The timeouts used during release testing were as follows:
<pre>
	O2CB_HEARTBEAT_THRESHOLD = 31
	O2CB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000
	O2CB_KEEPALIVE_DELAY_MS = 2000
	O2CB_RECONNECT_DELAY_MS = 2000
</pre>
<span style="color: #F00;">
The default cluster timeouts in OCFS2 1.2.6 for EL5 have been set to the above.
<b>The upcoming release, OCFS2 1.2.7 (EL4 and EL5), will make the above default
for both EL4 and EL5.</b></span><br>

<font size=+1>
<li>Can one change these timeout values in a round robin fashion?
</font>
No. The o2net handshake protocol ensures that all the timeout values for
both the nodes are consistent and fails if any value differs. This failed
connection results in a failed mount, the reason for which is always listed
in dmesg.

<font size=+1>
<li>How does one set these O2CB timeouts?
</font>
Umount all OCFS2 volumes and shutdown the O2CB cluster. If not already,
upgrade to OCFS2 1.2.5 and OCFS2 TOOLS 1.2.4. Then use o2cb configure to
set the new values. Do the same on all nodes. Start mounting volumes only
after the timeouts have been set on all nodes.
<pre>
	# service o2cb configure
	Configuring the O2CB driver.

	This will configure the on-boot properties of the O2CB driver.
	The following questions will determine whether the driver is loaded on
	boot.  The current values will be shown in brackets ('[]').  Hitting
	<ENTER> without typing an answer will keep that current value.  Ctrl-C
	will abort.

<font size=+1>
<li>What are the changes in EL5 as compared to EL4 as it pertains to OCFS2?
</font>
<ul>
<li>The in-memory filesystems, configfs and debugfs, have new mountpoints.
configfs is mounted at /sys/kernel/config, instead of /config, and debugfs at /sys/kernel/debug,
instead of /debug. (dlmfs still mounts at the old mountpoint /dlm.)
<li>While not related to EL5 per se, it just so happens that the default O2CB Cluster timeouts
for OCFS2 on EL5 are different than on EL4. This difference is temporary in nature as in the next
release of OCFS2 (1.2.7), the same timeouts will be made defaults for both EL4 and EL5.
