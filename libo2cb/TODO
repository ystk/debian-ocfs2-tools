* change the name and/or path of /etc/cluster.conf to something friendlier
  maybe /etc/sysconfig/cluster/xxxx or similar
* change the cluster.conf format to jlbec's stanza style
* harden the tools for setuid-ness
* fix mount.ocfs2 to handle other normal mount options appropriately (at least
  handle rw, which is passed magically by /sbin/mount)
