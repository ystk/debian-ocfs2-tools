.SH "NAME"
o2cb \- Default cluster stack of the \fIOCFS2\fR file system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP 
\fBo2cb\fR is the default cluster stack of the \fIOCFS2\fR file system. It is an in-kernel
cluster stack that includes a node manager (o2nm) to keep track of the nodes in the cluster,
a disk heartbeat agent (o2hb) to detect node live-ness, a network agent (o2net) for intra-cluster
node communication and a distributed lock manager (o2dlm) to keep track of lock resources.
It also includes a synthetic file system, dlmfs, to allow applications to access the
in-kernel dlm.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The stack is configured using the \fBo2cb(8)\fR cluster configuration utility and operated
(online/offline/status) using the \fIo2cb\fR init service.

.TP
\fBCLUSTER CONFIGURATION\fR

It has two configuration files. One for the cluster layout (/etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf) and the
other for the cluster timeouts, etc. (/etc/sysconfig/o2cb). More information about these
two files can be found in \fBocfs2.cluster.conf(5)\fR and \fBo2cb.sysconfig(5)\fR.

The \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack supports two heartbeat modes, namely, \fBlocal\fR and \fBglobal\fR.
Only one heartbeat mode can be active at any one time.

\fBLocal heartbeat\fR refers to disk heartbeating on all shared devices. In this mode, the
\fIheartbeat is started during mount and stopped during umount\fR. This mode is easy to
setup as it does not require configuring heartbeat devices. The one drawback in this mode
is the overhead on servers having a large number of \fIOCFS2\fR mounts. For example, a server
with 50 mounts will have 50 heartbeat threads. This is the default heartbeat mode.

\fBGlobal heartbeat\fR, on the other hand, refers to heartbeating on specific shared devices.
These devices are normal \fIOCFS2\fR formatted volumes that could also be mounted and used
as clustered file systems. In this mode, the \fIheartbeat is started during cluster online
and stopped during cluster offline\fR. While this mode can be used for all clusters, it is
\fIstrongly\fR recommended for clusters having a large number of mounts.

More information on disk heartbeat is provided below.

.TP
\fBKERNEL CONFIGURATION\fR

Two sysctl values need to be set for \fBo2cb\fR to function properly. The first, panic_on_oops,
must be enabled to turn a kernel oops into a panic. If a kernel thread required for \fBo2cb\fR
to function crashes, the system must be reset to prevent a cluster hang. If it is not set,
another node may not be able to distinguish whether a node is unable to respond or slow
to respond.

The other related sysctl parameter is panic, which specifies the number of seconds after
a panic that the system will be auto-reset. Setting this parameter to zero disables autoreset;
the cluster will require manual intervention. This is not preferred in a cluster
environment.

To manually enable panic on oops and set a 30 sec timeout for reboot on panic, do:

.nf
.ft 6
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic_on_oops
# echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/panic
.ft
.fi

To enable the above on every boot, add the following to /etc/sysctl.conf:

.nf
.ft 6
kernel.panic_on_oops = 1
kernel.panic = 30
.ft
.fi

.TP
\fBOS CONFIGURATION\fR

The \fBo2cb\fR cluster stack also requires iptables (firewalling) to be either disabled
or modified to allow network traffic on the private network interface. The port used by
\fBo2cb\fR is specified in /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf.

.SH "DISK HEARTBEAT"
.PP
O2CB uses disk heartbeat to detect node liveness. The disk heartbeat thread, \fBo2hb\fR,
periodically reads and writes to a heartbeat file in a OCFS2 file system. Its write payload
contains a sequence number that it increments in each write. This allows other nodes
reading the same heartbeat file to detect the change and associate that with a live node.
Conversely, a node whose sequence number has stopped changing is marked as a possible dead
node. Possible. Not confirmed. That is because it just could be slow I/Os.

To differentiate between a dead node and one that has slow I/Os, O2CB has a disk heartbeat
threshold (timeout). Only nodes whose sequence number has not incremented for that duration
are marked dead.

However that node may not be dead but just experiencing slow I/O. To prevent that, the
heartbeat thread keeps track of the time elapsed since the last completed write. If that
time exceeds the timeout, it forces a self-fence. It does so to prevent other nodes from
marking it as dead while it is still alive.

This self-fencing scheme has proven to be very reliable as it relies on kernel timers
and pci bus reset. External fencing, while attractive, is rarely as reliable as it relies
on external hardware and software that is prone to failure due to misconfiguration, etc.

Having said that, O2CB disk heartbeat has had its share of problems with self fencing.
Nodes experiencing slow I/O on only one of multiple devices have to initiate self-fence.

This is because in the default \fBlocal heartbeat\fR scheme, nodes in a cluster may not
be heartbeating on the same set of devices.

The \fBglobal heartbeat\fR mode addresses this shortcoming by introducing a scheme
that forces all nodes to heartbeat on the same set of devices. In this scheme, a node
experiencing a slowdown in I/O on a device may not need to initiate self-fence. It will
only have to do so if it encounters slowdown on 50% or more of the heartbeat devices.
In a cluster with 3 heartbeat regions, a slowdown in 1 region will be tolerated. In
a cluster with 5 regions, a slowdown in 2 will be tolerated.

It is for this reason, this mode is recommended for users that have 3 or more OCFS2
mounts.

O2CB allows upto \fB32\fR heartbeat regions to be configured in the global heartbeat mode.

.SH "ONLINE CLUSTER MODIFICATION"
.PP
The O2CB cluster stack allows \fIadding and removing nodes in an online cluster\fR when run
in the \fBglobal\fR heartbeat mode. Use the \fBo2cb(8)\fR utility to make the changes
in the configuration and (re)online the cluster using the \fIo2cb\fR init script. The user
\fBmust\fR do the same on \fIall\fR nodes in the cluster. The cluster will not allow any
new cluster mounts if the node configuration on all nodes is not the same.

The removal of nodes will only succeed if that node is no longer in use. If the user removes
an active node from the configuration, the re-online will fail.

The cluster stack also allows \fIadding and removing heartbeat regions in an online cluster\fR.
Use the \fBo2cb(8)\fR utility to make the changes in the configuration file and (re)online
the cluster using the \fIo2cb\fR init script. The user \fBmust\fR do the same on \fIall\fR
nodes in the cluster. The cluster will not allow any new cluster mounts if the heartbeat
region configuration on all nodes is not the same.

The removal of heartbeat regions will only succeed if the active heartbeat region count is
greater than \fB3\fR. This is to protect against edge conditions that can destabilize the
cluster.

.SH "GETTING STARTED"
.PP
The first step in configuring \fBo2cb\fR is deciding whether to setup \fBlocal\fR or \fBglobal\fR
heartbeat. If \fBglobal\fR heartbeat, then one has to format atleast one heartbeat device.

To format a OCFS2 volume with global heartbeat enabled, do:

.nf
.ps 8
.ft 6
# mkfs.ocfs2 --cluster-stack=o2cb --cluster-name=webcluster --global-heartbeat -L "hbvol1" /dev/sdb1
.ft
.ps
.fi

Once formatted, setup /etc/ocfs2/cluster.conf following the example provided in \fBocfs2.cluster.conf(5)\fR.

If \fBlocal\fR heartbeat, then one can setup cluster.conf without any heartbeat devices. The next
step is starting the cluster.

To online the cluster stack, do:

.nf
.ft 6
# service o2cb online
Loading stack plugin "o2cb": OK
Loading filesystem "ocfs2_dlmfs": OK
Mounting ocfs2_dlmfs filesystem at /dlm: OK
Setting cluster stack "o2cb": OK
Registering O2CB cluster "webcluster": OK
Setting O2CB cluster timeouts : OK
Starting global heartbeat for cluster "webcluster": OK
.ft
.fi

Once the cluster stack is online, new \fBOCFS2\fR volumes can be formatted normally
without specifying the cluster stack information. \fImkfs.ocfs2(8)\fR will pick up that
information automatically.

.nf
.ft 6
# mkfs.ocfs2 -L "datavol" /dev/sdc1
.ft
.fi

Meanwhile existing volumes can be converted to the new cluster stack using \fBtunefs.ocfs2(8)\fR
utility.

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
# tunefs.ocfs2 --update-cluster-stack /dev/sdd1
Updating on-disk cluster information to match the running cluster.
DANGER: YOU MUST BE ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT NO OTHER NODE IS USING THIS FILESYSTEM
BEFORE MODIFYING ITS CLUSTER CONFIGURATION.
Update the on-disk cluster information? y
.ft
.ps
.fi

Another utility \fBmounted.ocfs2(8)\fR is useful is listing all the \fIOCFS2\fR volumes
alonghwith the cluster stack information.

To get a list of OCFS2 volumes, do:

.nf
.ps 9
.ft 6
# mounted.ocfs2 -d
Device     Stack  Cluster     F  UUID                              Label

/dev/sdc1  None                  23878C320CF3478095D1318CB5C99EED  localmount
/dev/sdd1  o2cb   webcluster  G  8AB016CD59FC4327A2CDAB69F08518E3  webvol

/dev/sdh1  o2cb   webcluster  G  BBA1DBD0F73F449384CE75197D9B7098  scratch
.ft
.ps
.fi

The \fIo2cb\fR init script can also be used to check the status of the cluster,
offline the cluster, etc.

To check the status of the cluster stack, do:

.nf
.ft 6
